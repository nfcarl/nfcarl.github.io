								<h2>Research Experience<h2>
								<p>My research career began the end of my freshman year of college, when I was accepted to the NASA Space Grant Program under the mentorship of Dr. Sanchayeeta Borthakur. My main research interest is in galaxy evolution, and through this program I have studied the star formation history of the nearby, spiral galaxy NGC 3344, using techniques ranging from data reduction and source extraction to spectral energy distribution modeling. Over the past 3 years, I have delivered talks at the Arizona Space Grant Consortium Statewide Symposium and presented posters at Arizona State University. I also completed over 20 hours of science education outreach per school year as a part of the Space Grant Internship.<br />
During the summer of 2024, I was accepted into The Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early Identification Program at the University of Chicago. I worked with Dr. Alexander Ji to analyze the chemical abundances in the stellar stream, GD-1. My work led to the discovery of multiple stellar populations and a carbon-enhanced metal-poor binary star, and is in the process of being published. I gave a 15 minute talk on my findings at the Leadership Alliance National Symposium in Hartford, Connectticut. <br />
In 2023, I was a part of the Research Experience for Non-Traditional Undergraduates hosted by Brown University and Arizona State University. I worked with Dr. Steven Murray, Dr. Judd Bowman, and Dr. Jonathan Pober debugging and developing code for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array validation team. I solved an error that was causing artificial structure in the sky beam, and my results were published in a memo.

								<h2>Science Outreach
								</h2>
								<p>I firmly believe that science outreach and communication is just as important as research. As a queer, neurodivergent person in STEM, I want to give back to my community as my career grows and create a more inclusive future. </p>

								<h2>Eclipse Ambassador Program: Astronomical Society of the Pacific
								</h2>
								<p>During the 2023-2024 eclipses,I completed educational training through the Astronomical Society of the Pacific on science communication and teaching. I co-hosted two in-person outreach events on campus in coordination with the the School of Earth and Space Exploration, including an eclipse safety and preparation meeting and a viewing party that amassed over 2000 people.

								<h2>The Association of Women in Physics</h2>
								<p>In the spring of 2024, I co-founded the Association of Women in Physics, with the aim of promoting community and science outreach for gender-minorities in physics. This year, I was elected President, and I am working to improve inclusivity and representation in the Arizona State physics department. </p>

								<h2>The Society of Physics Students</h2>
								<p>I am the Outreach Coordinator for the Society of Physics Students, and I work to organize educational and outreach events in the local area, in addition to helping plan and run club meetings. We often do physics demonstrations and shows for public events at Arizona State.</p>
